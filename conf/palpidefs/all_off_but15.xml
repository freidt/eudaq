Syntax rules:
1. Address tags define the value for base, rgn and sub out of which the address is calculated
   They have to be in the order base, rgn, sub to allow proper searching of the DOM
2. The token %base% %rgn% %sub% are replaced in any tag content by the current value
3. If the title tag is present a new line with a Save/Load button in the GUI is generated. All following value tags are put in the same line until the next title tag
4. The optional description tag is shown as tooltip on the checkbox/edit field
5. Value tags need to contain the first bit (attribute begin). The width is 1 by default and can be specified to be larger.
   One bit wide fields are shown as checkbox. Wider fields as edit field.
   Wider fields can be forced to be shown as checkboxes by providing the <display>bits</display> tag within the value tag
   Default values can be specified with the tag default, otherwise it is 0
   Optional content values can be specified with the tag content. The content tag overrides the value given at the default tag.
6. Repetitions can be written in any address tag by adding the attributes repetition_count and  repetition_attribute. This tag and all its children are duplicated repetition_count times by increasing the attribute indicated with repetition_attribute by 1 each time. The start value is given in the attribute itself.
